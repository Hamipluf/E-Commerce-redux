# E-Commerce Demo

## It is a basic example of an E-Commerce, which connects to the backend with the stripe api, which allows me to receive payments with cards and more than 25 payment methods. 

### The app is built with create-react-app, firebase auth, axios, express, stripe, tailwind and react-router-dom.
